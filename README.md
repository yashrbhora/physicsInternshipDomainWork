**Update (September 2022):** This code is the result of self-study and was written prior to having any formal instruction in programming. Therefore, it is messy and does not follow ideal style.  My goal at the time was simply to get the professor his desired analysis. Since then, my programming skills have improved and more recent projects are reflective of my coding abilities. I must admit, however, that it was fun naming variables that represented important physical quantities simply 'Yash'.

Here's all the programming I've done thus far in my Mahidol University Physics Internship. The goal was to find domains(areas of constant magnetic field magnitude) using NASA's Parker Solar Probe data.
